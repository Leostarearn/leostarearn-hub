# Desk Yoga Moves to Reduce Bloat & Stress

**Tight belly, stiff shoulders, and afternoon stress fog** — if that sounds like your workday, you're not alone.

Long hours at a desk can slow down digestion, restrict blood flow, and raise cortisol — the stress hormone linked to bloating and brain fog.

But here’s the good news:  
You can fix this *without leaving your desk*.

This home-based remedy is gentle, fast, and backed by science. These **desk yoga moves** stimulate digestion, relax your core, and activate your parasympathetic nervous system — your body’s built-in calm mode.

## 🧠 Why You Might Be Feeling This

Modern workdays come with three hidden gut triggers:

- **Poor posture** = compressed digestive organs  
- **Lack of movement** = slowed gut motility  
- **Chronic stress** = elevated cortisol & bloating

Over time, this combo creates a cycle: tension → stress → gut sluggishness → more discomfort.

💡 The fix? Movement + breath = flow.

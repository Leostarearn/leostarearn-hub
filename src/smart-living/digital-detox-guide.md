faq:
  - question: "What is a digital detox?"
    answer: "A digital detox is a period of intentional disconnection from screens — especially smartphones and social media — to reset your mind, reduce stress, and reconnect with real-world experiences. Most people try it for 24 hours, but even shorter sessions (like screen-free mornings) have benefits."

  - question: "What happens to your brain during a digital detox?"
    answer: "Your brain begins to slow down its overstimulation patterns. Dopamine levels stabilize, your attention span improves, and you feel less 'mentally jittery.' Many people report clearer thinking, better sleep, and lower anxiety after just one screen-free day."

  - question: "How long should I detox from screens?"
    answer: "Start with a 24-hour detox once per week — or even just one evening per week if you’re new. You can build up to longer breaks as it gets easier. The key is consistency. Regular detoxes help retrain your brain and reduce tech dependence."

  - question: "What should I do during a digital detox?"
    answer: "Try analog activities that don’t involve screens: go for a walk, read a paperback, cook, clean, journal, do yoga, or spend time with family. The goal isn’t boredom — it’s calm, grounded living."

  - question: "Is it okay to use my phone for emergencies?"
    answer: "Yes — a digital detox is flexible, not rigid. Keep your phone on airplane mode or use it only for essential calls or texts. You don’t have to be unreachable to benefit from a detox."

  - question: "Will a detox help my focus and energy?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Constant screen use fragments your attention and drains your mental stamina. A digital detox gives your mind a break, helping you regain focus, mental energy, and motivation for meaningful work."

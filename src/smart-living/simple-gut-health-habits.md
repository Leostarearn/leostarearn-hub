<h2 id="gut-basics">🥦 Gut Basics 101</h2>

Your gut isn’t just your stomach — it’s an entire ecosystem. From mouth to colon, your digestive tract is home to over 100 trillion microbes that help you break down food, absorb nutrients, and even regulate hormones.

When this system is off? You feel it.

* Bloating
* Brain fog
* Constipation or diarrhea
* Breakouts and skin flareups
* Anxiety or low energy

Healing your gut means feeding the good bacteria, clearing out the junk, and letting your body reset — one bite at a time.

> “Your gut health affects nearly every part of your body. It’s your inner operating system.” — Dr. Maya Chandrasekar, Integrative Nutritionist

<h2 id="why-gut-health-matters">🧬 Why Gut Health Matters</h2>

Science calls the gut your “second brain.” Why?

Because it:

* Produces over 90% of your serotonin (feel-good hormone)
* Regulates immune response and inflammation
* Affects nutrient absorption and energy levels
* Balances hormones — from stress to hunger to sleep

A weak gut = weak system. A nourished gut? That’s where wellness starts.

---

<h2 id="gut-habits">🍵 Daily Habits That Help</h2>

These micro-habits have big impact over time:

* ✅ Drink warm water with lemon first thing in the morning
* ✅ Chew every bite 15–30 times (digestion starts in the mouth!)
* ✅ Eat slowly — stop before you feel “full”
* ✅ Add 1 fermented food daily (yogurt, sauerkraut, miso)
* ✅ Go for a 10-minute walk after meals to aid digestion
* ✅ Sip peppermint or ginger tea mid-day
* ✅ Avoid screens while eating (yes, even Netflix!)

Each habit helps your digestive fire stay strong — and your gut bacteria stay happy.

  - question: "How long should a dopamine detox last?"
    answer: "Even a short dopamine detox lasting 6 to 24 hours can start to reset your brain’s reward system and improve your focus. Some people do a 6-hour detox on weekends, while others try a full 24-hour 'Digital Sabbath.' If you’re new to this, even unplugging for an afternoon can make a difference. The key is to do it regularly — not perfectly."

  - question: "Do I have to quit everything during a detox?"
    answer: "No — you don’t need to cut off from life completely. A dopamine detox means stepping back from high-stimulation activities like scrolling, binge-watching, junk food, or constant multitasking. You can still enjoy calming, low-dopamine habits like journaling, cooking, walking, or reading a paperback. It’s about intention, not isolation."

  - question: "Will this help with brain fog or low motivation?"
    answer: "Yes. Many people report that even a short dopamine detox helps clear mental fog, improve energy, and bring back the desire to focus. By avoiding fast dopamine spikes, your brain relearns how to enjoy slower, deeper tasks again — like creative work, planning, or conversations without distraction."

  - question: "Is a dopamine detox backed by science?"
    answer: "Yes — while the term 'dopamine detox' is popularized online, it’s grounded in real neuroscience. Overstimulation from screens, sugar, and novelty can lead to dopamine desensitization. A detox reduces this overload, allowing your dopamine receptors to reset. Studies on neuroplasticity, reward processing, and digital fatigue all support this process."

  - question: "What can I do instead of using screens?"
    answer: "Try low-stimulation habits that reset your nervous system: walking without headphones, organizing a drawer, drinking herbal tea, stretching, meditating, cooking, or journaling. These feel slow at first, but help your brain relearn how to feel satisfied without digital overload."

  - question: "Can a dopamine detox improve sleep and stress levels?"
    answer: "Definitely. Reducing screen time — especially at night — helps your brain produce melatonin naturally and lowers cortisol (the stress hormone). This leads to better sleep, calmer moods, and lower anxiety. Many people find they sleep deeper and wake up more refreshed after a detox day."
